   In my honest and humble opinion, the holy trinity of computer science is data structures,
operational systems and algorithms. You may find this idea edgy, but if one does not have
a good grasp on those concepts, he or she will struggle quite a lot when dealing with more
sophisticated problems. After all, a true programmer is not someone who memorizes syntax,
but who can use computatinal tools to solve problems.
    With that in mind, i bought the Book " Introduction to Algorithms " by Cormen et al. This
repo will contain the solution of the most interesting problems from such book, grouped by chapter
( ish ).
